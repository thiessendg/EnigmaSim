<h1>Enigma</h1>
Enigma was used to encrypt messages during the second world-war. So the messages couldn't be read by the enemy.
At this programme you can see rotors, a reflector, a plugboard, an input-field, an output-field,  buttons, a message-list and a menu:
<ul>
	<li><b>Menu:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Settings:</b> You can choose the language and the model of the Enigma. You can select German or English as your language and the Enigma I or the Enigma M4 as the model of the Enigma.</li>
			<li><b>?:</b> In this menu the help and information about the programme can be found.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Rotors:</b> The shown rotors are the current selected rotors. These can be replaced by other rotors. Additionally, you can chose a specific character on the rotors.</li>
	<li><b>Reflector:</b> The reflector is a special rotor. The reflector also can be replaced.</li>
	<li><b>Plugboard:</b> At the plugboard you are able to set own connections between characters.</li>
	<li><b>Input-Field:</b> In the input-field you can insert your own message. This message will be encrypted and can be send over the network.</li>
	<li><b>Output-Field:</b> In the output-field the encrypted message is shown. This message can be send over the network.</li>
	<li><b>Buttons:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>„En-/Decrypt“:</b> If you click on this button, the message in the input-field will be  encrypted and printed to the output-field.</li>
			<li><b>„Send“:</b> This button sends the message in the output-field to the network. The encrypted message is received by the own Enigma, all other Enigmas and the Sniffer. The sent message also can be decrypted. To do so you have to know all settings.</li>
			<li><b>„Set“:</b> This button saves the current rotor configuration.</li>
			<li><b>„Reset“:</b> This button loads the last saved rotor configuration.</li>
			<li><b>„Clear“:</b> This button clears all current connections on the Plugboard.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Messages:</b> This List contains all received messages. You can receive message from your or other machines. The received messages also can be decrypted.</li>
