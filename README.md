Enigma Simulator

Enigma Simulation <https://github.com/thiessendg/EnigmaSim/>

DESCRIPTION
This program simulates the function of the Enigma used in World War II.

It simulates 5 versions (so far) of Enigma.  Enigma I, M3, M3 U-boat, M4, and M4 U-boat.

It is a work in progress, although, comparing to known messages and online simulators,
all tests have passed so far.

It uses multicast, address 224.0.0.2, port 2200.

ISSUES
    1) The Ringstellung, ring offsets, are hard coded in.  I am working on putting them
    in the GUI, but want to test to make sure they work.
    2) the test directory is where the old unit tests reside.  I have not updated them
    yet as I am making significant code changes.  They will also be updated for the latest
    version of JUnit.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
